# Task1
Task 1 completed ft. Elevate Labs


As part of this assignment, I would like you to use this dark themed and fully responsive template to create a landing page and be sure to use pure HTML and CSS. The page should be responsive and should not require any Javascript functionalities. The responsive design should be fluid and work well in any screen size. The mobile menu should work as a "hamburger" icon as well and it should use CSS only. The content should be well divided with both fluid images and responsive CSS. The theme should look sleek and professional with a dark background and bright purple details. The bar should be sticky as well.

This page should be well structured with a clearly defined hero section, a call to action, a collapsible multi-column footer section and a sticky hero navigation. The use of technology should be in HTML and CSS only. The HTML would semantic the structure and content while CSS should be used to style the page and make it responsive.
